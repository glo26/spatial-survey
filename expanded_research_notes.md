## 1. SATELLITE-BASED REMOTE SENSING (NASA, ESA, ESRI)

### NASA Earth Data Key Insights:

**Remote Sensing Fundamentals:**
- Remote sensing acquires information from a distance via satellites, spacecraft, and aircraft
- Detects and records reflected or emitted energy
- Provides global perspective for data-informed decision making
- Four types of resolution: radiometric, spatial, spectral, temporal

**AI Applications in Earth Observation:**
- AI enables searching through large amounts of data to find relationships
- Cloud computing (Earthdata Cloud) makes access, analysis, and visualization more efficient
- Python libraries, tutorials, and data recipes optimize cloud-based data work

**Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR):**
- Produces fine-resolution data detecting minute changes on Earth's surface
- Works day or night, regardless of weather conditions
- Critical for forest monitoring and biomass estimation

**Key Technologies:**
- Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents (ATBD) describe physical/mathematical algorithms
- Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for programmatic data access
- Processing levels from raw data to analysis-ready products
