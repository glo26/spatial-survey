## Remaining Items for A++ (97%+)

### Conference Paper
- Add more detailed method comparison tables
- Include quantitative meta-analysis of the 500 papers
- Add more figures (architecture diagrams, trend charts)

### Technical Report
- Expand to 35+ pages with more detailed implementation guides
- Add production code examples (FastAPI, Kubernetes)
- Add Gantt chart for project timeline
- Add team structure recommendations
