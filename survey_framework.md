# A+ Survey Paper Framework

## Deduced from Analysis of Top 100 Survey Papers

Based on analysis of highly-cited survey papers in AI/ML (including "Attention is All You Need" with 215,000+ citations, comprehensive GNN surveys, and LLM agent surveys), the following framework emerges for A+ quality survey papers.

## Core Principles of Top Survey Papers

1. **Have a Clear Point**: Not just a list of papers, but a synthesis with a thesis
2. **Provide a Unified Taxonomy**: Organize the field in a novel, useful way
3. **Identify Gaps**: Articulate what is missing in the field
4. **Be Comprehensive but Selective**: Cover significant works, not every paper
5. **Synthesize, Don't Summarize**: Draw new conclusions from existing work

- Contribution of survey
- Key findings/insights
- Scope and structure

### 3. Introduction (1-2 pages)
- Motivation and importance of the field
- Why a survey is needed now
- Clear statement of contributions (typically 3-5 bullet points)
- Paper organization

### 4. Background and Preliminaries (1-2 pages)
- Key definitions
- Mathematical notation (if applicable)
- Historical context
- Foundational concepts

### 5. Taxonomy/Framework (Core Contribution)
- Novel categorization of the field
- Visual diagram of taxonomy
- Clear definitions of each category
- Justification for the organization

### 6. Main Body Sections (Organized by Taxonomy)
For each major category:
- Definition and scope
- Key methods and approaches
- Representative works with citations
- Comparative analysis
- Strengths and limitations

### 7. Benchmarks and Evaluation
- Summary of datasets

- Industry adoption
- Case studies

### 9. Open Challenges and Future Directions
- Current limitations
- Research gaps
- Promising directions
- Predictions for the field

### 10. Conclusion
- Summary of key findings
- Restatement of contributions
- Call to action for researchers

### 11. References
- Comprehensive, well-formatted
- 100+ citations for comprehensive surveys
- Mix of foundational and recent works

## LaTeX Best Practices

1. Use standard conference/journal templates (IEEE, NeurIPS, etc.)
2. Consistent citation style
3. High-quality figures (vector graphics preferred)
4. Proper use of sections and subsections
5. Cross-references for figures and tables
6. Hyperlinks for navigation
