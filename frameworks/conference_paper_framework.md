## Part 1: Scientific Storytelling (The Narrative Arc)

Every A+ paper tells a compelling story. Use the **ABT (And, But, Therefore)** framework at all levels:

| Level | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| **Paper Level** | The entire paper follows one macro ABT narrative |
| **Section Level** | Each section has its own mini-ABT structure |
| **Paragraph Level** | Paragraphs connect ideas using ABT logic |

### The Macro ABT Narrative (Paper Level)

> **(AND)** The field of X has grown rapidly, with methods A, B, and C achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks Y and Z. This has led to significant progress in applications P and Q.
> 
> **(BUT)** However, the rapid pace of development has resulted in a fragmented landscape with no unified taxonomy, making it difficult for researchers and practitioners to navigate the field, compare methods, and identify key open challenges.
> 
> **(THEREFORE)** We present a comprehensive survey that, for the first time, organizes over 300 papers into a novel taxonomy, provides a systematic comparison of methods, and outlines a clear roadmap for future research.

## Part 2: Structural Framework (The Blueprint)

### Section 1: Abstract (150-250 words)

**A+ Abstract Template (ABT Structure):**

> **(AND)** [Field X] has seen remarkable progress, driven by advancements in [Method Y]. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on [Benchmark Z], demonstrating their potential for [Application A].
> 
> **(BUT)** Despite this progress, a significant gap remains in [specific area], and the lack of a unified framework for [comparing methods/understanding principles] hinders further advancement.
> 
> **(THEREFORE)** In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of [Number] papers, introducing a novel taxonomy that [explains contribution]. Our analysis reveals [Key Insight 1] and [Key Insight 2]. We conclude by outlining [Number] critical open challenges and a roadmap for future research, providing a valuable resource for the community.

### Section 2: Introduction (1.5-2 pages)

**A+ Introduction Structure (Funnel + ABT):**

| Paragraph | Content | Word Count |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| 1. Opening | Compelling statistic/observation (e.g., "The number of papers on X has grown 500% in 3 years...") | ~100 |
| 2. Context (AND) | Historical evolution, key milestones | ~150 |
| 3. Gap (BUT) | Clear articulation of the research gap | ~100 |
| 4. Contributions (THEREFORE) | 3-5 numbered items | ~100 |
| 5. Roadmap | Paper organization | ~50 |

### Section 3: Taxonomy and Categorization (1-2 pages)

**A+ Figure Design Specifications:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| **Tool** | Mermaid, draw.io, or TikZ for professional quality |
| **Colors** | High-contrast, black-and-white printable (e.g., use patterns, shapes) |
| **Layout** | Hierarchical, logical flow |
| **Caption** | Self-contained explanation of the taxonomy |

### Section 4: Core Technical Sections (4-6 pages)

**A+ Citation Integration Pattern:**

> Early work by [Author, Year] [1] established the foundation for [Topic]. This was later extended by [Author, Year] [2], who introduced [Method]. More recently, [Author, Year] [3] and [Author, Year] [4] have pushed the state-of-the-art by...

### Section 5: Evaluation and Benchmarks (1-2 pages)

**A+ Benchmark Table Template:**

| Benchmark | Task | # Samples | # Classes | Key Challenge |
|-----------|------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| [Name] | [Type] | [Number] | [Number] | [Description] |

### Section 6: Future Directions (1-1.5 pages)

**A+ Open Challenges Table:**

| Challenge | Research Question | Potential Approach | Impact |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------|
| [Name] | [Specific question] | [Suggested direction] | [High/Medium/Low] |
