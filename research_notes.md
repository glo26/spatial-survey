## Title Pattern Analysis for Maximum Citations

Based on IEEE guidelines and highly cited paper analysis:

### Optimal Title Characteristics:
1. **Length:** 6-10 words (shorter performs better)
2. **Structure:** Descriptive/Neutral preferred over Declarative
3. **Keywords:** Place important terms at BEGINNING
4. **Format Options:**
   - Simple: "Topic: A Survey"
   - Compound: "Topic: Subtitle with Specificity"
   - Question format can work for visionary papers

### Proposed Title Evaluation:

| Proposed Title | Words | Assessment |
|----------------|-------|------------|
| "Autonomous Spatial Intelligence: A Survey of Agentic AI Methods, Architectures, and Evaluation Frameworks" | 12 | Too long, but comprehensive |
| "Agentic AI for Spatial Intelligence: A Comprehensive Survey of Architectures, Evaluation, and Real-World Applications" | 13 | Too long |
| "Agentic AI for Spatial Intelligence: A Survey of Autonomous Planning, Reasoning, and Decision-Making in Critical Infrastructure" | 16 | Too long |

### Recommended Optimized Titles:
1. **"Spatial Intelligence Meets Agentic AI: A Comprehensive Survey"** (8 words)
2. **"Agentic AI for Spatial Reasoning: Methods, Benchmarks, and Applications"** (9 words)
3. **"Autonomous Spatial Intelligence: A Survey of Agentic AI Systems"** (9 words)
